**The Medieval Period**, also known as the Middle Ages, spanned from approximately 500 to 1500 CE, marking a transformative era in European history. It was a time of significant change, characterized by both conflict and innovation.

**Early Middle Ages (500-1000 CE):**

-   **Transition from Roman Empire:** The fall of the Roman Empire led to a period of fragmentation, with Germanic tribes carving up Western Europe into small kingdoms.
-   **Political Landscape:** Germanic tribes had no cities or written laws and were governed by elected kings. Warrior nobles swore oaths of loyalty to the kings in exchange for weapons and booty.
-   **Europe as a Frontier:** Europe became an isolated and backward region, cut off from more advanced civilizations in other parts of the world.
-   **Invasions:** Western Europe faced waves of invasions from Muslims, Magyars, and Vikings, which disrupted society and created a need for local protection.
    -   Muslim forces pushed into the Mediterranean from the south.
    -   Magyars moved into Eastern Europe from the east.
    -   Vikings raided and settled along the coasts and rivers from the north.
-   **Rise of the Franks:** The Frankish kingdom emerged as the strongest and most successful. Clovis, the king of the Franks, converted to Christianity, which became a major theme of the period.
-   **Charlemagne's Empire:** Charlemagne, a Frankish ruler, built an empire across France, Germany, and part of Italy around 800 CE. He was crowned "emperor" by the Pope, reviving the idea of a united Christian community.
    -   He appointed nobles to rule local regions and sent out officials called _missi dominici_ to oversee justice and governance.
    -   Charlemagne promoted Latin learning and established a palace school at Aachen.
    -   His empire was later divided into three regions by the Treaty of Verdun in 843.
-   **The Rise of Islam:** Islam emerged as a powerful force in the Mediterranean, expanding into North Africa and Spain. The Battle of Tours in 732 CE halted Muslim advancement into Western Europe.

**Feudalism and the Manor Economy:**

-   **Feudal System:** Feudalism evolved as a response to the need for protection in a time of weak central authority.
    -   It was a decentralized system where powerful lords divided their land among lesser lords, or vassals.
    -   Vassals pledged loyalty and service to their lords in exchange for land (fief).
    -   Feudal relationships were complex, with vassals often having multiple lords.
-   **Feudal Pyramid:** Medieval society had a strict hierarchy, with the monarch at the top, followed by powerful lords, vassals, knights, and serfs.
-   **Knights:** Knights were mounted warriors who trained from boyhood and followed a code of chivalry. They were essential for defense and participated in tournaments when fighting decreased.
    -   Chivalry required them to be brave, loyal, and generous, and to protect women.
-   **Castles:** Castles were built for defense and included features like walls, arrow loops, drawbridges, and towers.
-   **Manor System:** The manor was the heart of the medieval economy and a self-sufficient estate where peasants lived and worked.
    -   Most peasants were **serfs**, bound to the land but not slaves. They had to work for the lord and provide payments in goods and services.
    -   In return, they received the right to farm some land for themselves and were guaranteed protection.
-   **Noblewomen:** Noblewomen played active roles, managing the household, supervising vassals, and performing agricultural and medical tasks. They often had arranged marriages.

**The Medieval Church:**

-   **Influence of the Church:** The Catholic Church was the most powerful unifying force in Western Europe during the Middle Ages. It shaped nearly every aspect of life and had its own laws called **canon law**.
-   **Authority of the Church:** The Church controlled who could participate in sacraments, which were seen as essential for salvation. The Pope was the head of the Church, claimed authority over secular rulers, and was the lord over the Papal States in Italy.
-   **Church Hierarchy:** The Church was organized into a hierarchy, with the pope at the top, followed by bishops and priests.
-   **Monasteries and Convents:** Monks and nuns devoted their lives to spiritual goals in monasteries and convents. They provided social services, preserved ancient writings, and maintained gardens and hospitals.
-   **Reform Movements:** Corruption and moral decay within the Church led to demands for reform. The Cluniac movement and the establishment of preaching orders like the Franciscans aimed to end abuses.
-   **Excommunication and Interdict:** **Excommunication** was a severe punishment that banned individuals from the Church, and an **interdict** was a collective punishment that closed churches in a region or kingdom.
-   **Daily Life:** For peasants, religion was linked to the routines of daily life, with priests performing baptisms and marriages.
-   **Views of Women:** The Church's views of women changed over time, with growing restrictions on their activities as the Church grew more powerful.

**Economic Expansion and Change:**

-   **Agricultural Revolution:** New technologies led to an agricultural revolution.
-   **Revival of Trade:** As trade revived, money reappeared, leading to new business practices like banking.
-   **Growth of Towns:** Small centers of trade developed into the first real medieval cities.
    -   Towns gained charters that granted them rights and privileges.
    -   The saying "town air makes free," became popular with runaway serfs.
-   **Guilds:** Merchant guilds and craft guilds dominated life in medieval towns, regulating trade and providing social services.
-   **New Class:** A new middle class of merchants, traders, and artisans emerged.
-   **Urban Life:** Medieval cities were crowded and unsanitary but were hubs of trade and cultural exchange.

**High Middle Ages (1050-1450 CE):**

-   **Growth of Royal Power:** Monarchs worked to consolidate their power, building strong national governments. Strategies included maintaining relationships with the Pope, building standing armies, establishing court systems, direct taxation and consolidating land.
-   **Magna Carta:** The Magna Carta was a charter that nobles forced the monarch to accept, recognizing certain rights of the nobles and establishing that the monarch must obey the laws.
-   **Universities:** The need for an educated clergy and literate rulers, and the need for the middle class to be educated led to the establishment of universities.
-   **Cathedrals:** Large churches were built in the Gothic style, which included cross shapes, large naves, relics, sculptures, rose windows, spires and flying buttresses. Cathedrals were the tallest buildings in the cities and demonstrated technological and economic progress.

**Challenges and Transformations:**

-   **The Black Death:** The Black Death, or plague, killed a significant portion of Europe's population, leading to social and economic disruption.
-   **Anti-Semitism:** Prejudice against Jews, or anti-Semitism, increased during this time.
-   **Looking Ahead:** The economic and social changes of the Middle Ages set the stage for the modern era.

**PRIMES**
The acronym PRIMES is a helpful tool to study this period. By asking questions about:

-   **Political** structures such as who rules, the type of government, and how it changes
-   **Religious** aspects such as beliefs, deities, and organization
-   **Intellectual** ideas such as advances in knowledge, philosophy and literature
-   **Military** organization and impacts
-   **Economic** systems like trade, agriculture and finance
-   **Social** structures like class systems and relationships.
    We can understand the medieval world as a whole.
