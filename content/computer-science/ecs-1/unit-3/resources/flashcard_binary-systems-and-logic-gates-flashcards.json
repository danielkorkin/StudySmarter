		{
			"term": "OR Gate",
			"definition": "Outputs true (1) if at least one input is true."
		},
		{
			"term": "NOT Gate",
			"definition": "Inverts the input value (true becomes false, and vice versa)."

		{
			"term": "Ohm's Law",
			"definition": "Ohm's Law states that the voltage (V) across a conductor is directly proportional to the current (I) flowing through it, with resistance (R) as the proportionality constant."
		},
		{
			"term": "Ohm's Law Formula",
			"definition": "V = I * R"
		},
		{
			"term": "Voltage (V)",
